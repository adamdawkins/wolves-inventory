Feature: Add inventory items to system
  As the inventory manager
  I want to add an inventory item to a the system,
  so that I can track the team inventory.

  * I should be able to add the following information:
    - size
    - quantity
    - a label for unique identification
    - purchase date
  * I should be able to select an item type
  * I should be able to tag an item with a squad.
  * 'Contact Kit' items should not have a quantity - we want to track each one
    individually, because they are expensive
